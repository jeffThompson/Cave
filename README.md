Cave
====

A low-res sonic game for tablet, part of a series of haptic and non-visual games created with generous funding from Harvestworks' Cultural Innovation Fund.

Navigate an algorithmically-generated cave system with changing reverb based on the ceiling height.

1. `data` folder includes audio files (including some extras not used)
2. `ProcessFiles` folder includes the Adobe Illustrator file used in the title screen, and a [Max/MSP](http://cycling74.com) patch used for all the sound design - note this is the same setup used in the "Sonar" game from this same collection
3. `Screenshots` folder - self explanatory!

This game is intended for Android tablet, especially the Nexus 10. Built using [Processing's Android mode](http://www.processing.org).
